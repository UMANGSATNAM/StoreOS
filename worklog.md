Task ID: feat-1
Agent: fullstack-improver
Task: Fix store setup flow and add key features

Work Log:
- **Task 1: Fixed StoreSetup.tsx to pass taxRate to Zustand**
  - Updated `setStore` call in handleSubmit to include all fields from the created store response: taxRate, ownerName, city, state, phone, address, gstNumber
  - Template field now uses `createdStore.template || onboardingTemplate || 'default'` fallback
  - This ensures BillingPos uses the correct tax rate instead of defaulting to 18% GST

- **Task 2: Fixed Login Flow to load store data into Zustand**
  - Updated `/api/auth/login/route.ts` to return `store` and `subscription` at the top level of the response (in addition to nested in user)
  - Updated `LoginPage.tsx` to read store/subscription from the top-level response fields
  - Added full store field mapping including taxRate, ownerName, city, state, phone, address, gstNumber
  - This ensures returning users get complete store data after login

- **Task 3: Added Seed Data for Multiple Niches**
  - Completely rewrote `/api/seed/route.ts` with a `NicheSeedConfig` architecture
  - Added `niche` body parameter (default: 'restaurant') to POST /api/seed
  - Added **Grocery/Kirana** niche config: Patel Fresh Mart, Ahmedabad, 0% tax, 6 categories (Grains, Pulses, Oils, Spices, Dairy, Snacks), 25 products with realistic Indian grocery items (Rice ₹60/kg, Atta ₹280/5kg, Dal ₹120/kg, Oil ₹180/L, etc.), some low stock items
  - Added **Salon & Spa** niche config: Glamour Studio, Delhi, 18% GST, 5 categories (Hair Services, Skin Care, Nail Care, Bridal Packages, Men Services), 22 services (Haircut ₹300, Facial ₹800, Hair Color ₹1500, Manicure ₹400, Keratin ₹4000, Bridal Makeup ₹15000, etc.)
  - Each niche has niche-specific seed data (restaurant: tables, salon: appointments)
  - Orders are auto-generated with correct tax rates per niche
  - Also cleans up niche-specific data (appointments, vehicles, rooms, members, students) on re-seed

- **Task 4: Added Quick Search in Dashboard**
  - Added `globalSearch` field and `setGlobalSearch` action to Zustand store
  - Made the top-bar search functional in PosDashboard: pressing Enter or clicking search icon triggers `handleGlobalSearch()`
  - Search logic: queries products API first, then customers API; navigates to Products tab if products match, Customers tab if only customers match, Products tab as default
  - ProductsPanel and CustomersPanel now read `globalSearch` from Zustand and pre-fill their local search
  - Global search is consumed (cleared) after being applied to prevent stale values

Stage Summary:
- Store onboarding now correctly passes all store fields (especially taxRate) to Zustand
- Login flow now loads complete store + subscription data into Zustand
- Seed API supports 3 niches: restaurant, grocery, salon (via body.niche parameter)
- Dashboard search bar is functional with smart tab navigation
- Lint passes with no errors

Work Log:
- Performed QA testing using agent-browser on landing page, auth flow, dashboard, billing/POS

- **BUG FIX: Theme toggle not working** — Replaced Zustand-based theme management with next-themes (ThemeProvider in layout.tsx). Now properly applies `dark` class to document.documentElement.
- **BUG FIX: Tax rate hardcoded** — BillingPos was using hardcoded 18% GST instead of store's configured rate. Fixed by reading `store.taxRate` from Zustand with fallback to 18%.

Task ID: 2-a
Agent: Dashboard Styling Enhancer
Task: Fix visual bugs and enhance PosDashboard component styling

Work Log:

- **BUG FIX: Notification Bell** — Replaced the `onClick={() => setNotifications(0)}` counter reset with a proper notification dropdown panel. Now uses `useState` with an array of 5 mock notifications (New Order Received, Low Stock Alert, Subscription Reminder, Stock Restocked, Refund Processed), each with icon, title, description, time ago, and unread indicator. Added "Mark all read" button and "View All Notifications" link. Unread count badge shows dynamically based on `unread` property.

- **BUG FIX: Stat Cards Border Inconsistency** — Changed all stat cards from colored borders (`border-emerald-200`, `border-sky-200`, etc.) to consistent thin gray borders (`border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700`) with a 4px left colored border accent (`border-l-4 border-l-emerald-500`, etc.) using each card's theme color.

- **BUG FIX: Search Placeholder** — Shortened from "Search products, customers, orders... (Enter to search)" to just "Search..." since the icon already implies search functionality.

- **BUG FIX: Empty Cart State** — Replaced the simple disconnected icon in BillingPos with an engaging illustration-like design: circular container with shopping bag icon, a green plus badge overlay, "Your cart is empty" heading, "Tap products to add them here" subtitle, and a pulsing "Ready to bill" indicator.

- **ENHANCEMENT: Notification Dropdown Panel** — Full dropdown with:
  - Header with "Notifications" title and "Mark all read" button
  - Scrollable list (max-h-72) of 5 notification items
  - Each item has: colored icon in rounded container, title with blue dot for unread, description, time ago
  - Unread items have subtle sky-50 background
  - "View All Notifications" footer button
  - Uses existing DropdownMenu components

- **ENHANCEMENT: Stat Cards with Gradients and Trends** — Added:
  - Subtle gradient backgrounds (`bg-gradient-to-br from-emerald-50/80 to-white`) that vary per card
  - Hover effects: `hover:shadow-md hover:scale-[1.02] transition-all duration-200`
  - Trend indicators: up/down arrow + percentage (e.g., "+12.5% ↑", "-2.1% ↓")
  - Green for positive trends, red for negative

- **ENHANCEMENT: Sidebar Footer Polish** — Replaced `SidebarSeparator` with a custom thin divider (`h-px bg-gray-200/70 dark:bg-gray-700/50`) between subscription badge and user profile. Added more consistent padding (`px-3 py-2` for subscription, `px-2` for user info). Divider is hidden when sidebar is collapsed.

- **ENHANCEMENT: Recent Orders with Payment Icons** — Added payment method icons (Banknote for Cash, Smartphone for UPI, CreditCard for Card) next to each order's time. Added `hover:scale-[1.01] active:scale-[0.99]` animation for scale-up effect on hover. Added `paymentMethod` field to `recentOrders` state type.

- **ENHANCEMENT: Sales Chart Dual-Axis** — Changed from `AreaChart` to `ComposedChart` with:
  - Left Y-axis: Sales in ₹ (emerald area chart with gradient fill)
  - Right Y-axis: Orders count (sky blue dashed line)
  - Custom tooltip showing both values formatted
  - Legend item in chart summary: "Orders (right axis)" with dashed line indicator
  - Dots on both lines for 7-day view

- Added imports: `Banknote`, `TrendingDown`, `PackageCheck`, `RefreshCcw` from lucide-react

Work Log:

- **Landing Page - Hero POS Mockup Enhancements:**
  - Replaced setInterval-based count-up animation with framer-motion `useSpring` for the 3 stat values (₹24,580, 142, 384). Uses spring physics with `stiffness: 50, damping: 20` for natural-feeling animation.

- **Landing Page - Testimonial Carousel:**
  - Replaced static desktop testimonial grid with a unified carousel system.
  - Desktop now shows all 3 cards with auto-rotate slide animation (`AnimatePresence` with `x: carouselDirection * 60` slide), plus the active testimonial gets a highlighted state with `ring-2 ring-emerald-500/30 scale-[1.02]`.

Unresolved Issues / Risks:
- Agent-browser click doesn't trigger React onClick reliably (workaround: use JS click)
- Some niche-specific features are placeholder-level (e.g., Zomato integration, WhatsApp API)
- PWA/offline mode not yet implemented
- No actual Razorpay/Stripe integration (mock only)
- Kitchen Display orders are from seed data; real-time WebSocket integration not yet implemented
- i18n only has basic structure, not all strings translated

Priority Recommendations for Next Phase:
1. Implement WebSocket real-time updates for Kitchen Display
2. Add PWA with service worker for offline billing capability
3. Add real Razorpay payment integration with webhook handler
4. Implement WhatsApp Business API notification service
5. Complete i18n translations for all UI strings (English + Hindi)
6. Add customer-facing online ordering page per store
7. Add barcode/QR code scanning for products
8. Add multi-store support (switch between stores)
